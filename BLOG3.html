        The 1960s witnessed a surge in innovative digital graphics, fueled by
        the increasing prevalence of computers. By the 1970s, computer graphics
        had evolved into a recognized art form, with a growing number of
        individuals exploring its creative potential. Advancements in graphic
        design tools and computer software persisted, with the University of
        Utah receiving government funding that spurred pioneering animation
        projects. Among these, Ed Catmull's Hand/Face (1972) stands out. The
        capabilities of computer animation continued to advance, captivating
        more enthusiasts who explored the possibilities of this evolving medium.
        This trajectory ultimately led to the emergence of today's CGI
        masterpieces that dominate contemporary media.
      </div>
      <div class="computer-a">
        As early as the 1940s, individuals initiated experimentation with
        computer graphics primarily for scientific and research purposes. John
        Whitney Sr., a composer, animator, and inventor, repurposed a Kerrison
        Predictor—a World War II-era anti-aircraft fire-control system—into a
        custom computer device. Utilizing mathematical control for more specific
        manipulation, they gained the capability to generate precise lines and
        shapes. Whitney Sr., collaborating with the renowned graphic designer
        Saul Bass, applied this technology to animate the opening title sequence
        of Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo. Notably, Vertigo is recognized
        as one of the initial live-action films to incorporate computer
        animation.

        Walt Disney Studios' Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) holds the
        distinction of being the inaugural animated feature film. Employing the
        traditional animation technique of cel animation, the film involved
        creating two-dimensional visuals on transparent celluloid sheets. This
        method facilitated the transfer of illustrations between frames,
        eliminating the need to redraw entirely for each frame. Consequently,
        this streamlined process saved time and reduced labor in the production
        of the film.

        Humorous Phases of Funny Faces (1906), crafted by British-American
        producer J. Stuart Blackton, is deemed by some as the inaugural film in
        the animation industry. Blackton employed stop-motion animation to
        portray a sequence of animated characters undergoing various movements
        in the three-minute film. Notably, this work holds the distinction of
        being the first animated film recorded on standard picture film,
        establishing it as the initial instance of an animated movie captured on
        authentic film.

        Émile Reynaud's Pauvre Pierrot (1892) achieved an extended viewing time
        by employing an elongated image roll for the praxinoscope. Notably, this
        work is frequently acknowledged as the inaugural animated film due to
        Reynaud's use of a hand-painted picture roll featuring 500 individual
        images, diverging from the conventional use of photographs. Nonetheless,
        film historians contend that Émile Cohl's Fantasmagorie (1908) holds the
        distinction of being the first true animated movie produced through
        traditional animation techniques.

        In 1877, the praxinoscope took over from the zoetrope, introducing a
        modification by substituting the zoetrope's narrow vertical slits with
        an inner circle of angled mirrors. This innovation aimed to enhance the
        clarity and vividness of the animation compared to the previous method
        of viewing moving illustrations through slits.

        Originating in 1868 and Latin for "moving picture," the kineograph,
        commonly known as the flipbook, is a compact collection of drawings.
        Each page of the flipbook depicts a distinct instance of movement. When
        the pages are rapidly flipped in succession, they create an animated
        sequence, bringing a scene to life.

        Following the phenakistoscope, the zoetrope emerged as its successor.
        This device took the form of a spinning cylinder and displayed images in
        successive stages of motion. Notably, the zoetrope allowed multiple
        viewers to observe the animated sequences simultaneously. The cylinder
        featured several vertical slits, preventing the spinning photographs
        from merging into a blur and enabling the viewer to perceive the
        distinct phases of motion.

        The Fantascope, also referred to as the phenakistoscope or sometimes
        spelled "phenakistiscope," was introduced around 1833. It utilized
        spinning cardboard disks adorned with paintings, and these disks were
        reflected in mirrors to generate the illusion of movement. However, the
        unique experience offered by the phenakistoscope was limited to one
        viewer at a time.

      <div class="thaumatrope-a">
        The thaumatrope, an optical toy from the nineteenth century, consisted
        of a picture disk suspended by two strings. When these strings were
        rotated, causing the disk to spin, the images on each side of the disk
        would blend into a single image. This effect was achieved through the
        "persistence of vision," an optical illusion wherein the eye continues
        to perceive movement even after the motion has ceased.

      <div class="magic-lantern-">
        In 1603, the magic lantern emerged as an image projection apparatus.
        This device featured a mirror positioned at the back of a light source,
        initially a candle, which directed light through elongated glass slides.
        As a result, the illustrations on these slides were projected, and when
        the slides were arranged consecutively, they created a semblance of
        movement. The magic lantern is recognized as the earliest form of
        "moving pictures."
