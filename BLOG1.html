        This concludes the Navigating College Life: A Survival Guide for
        Freshmen! Achieving balance is a fundamental aspect of life, and college
        serves as an excellent opportunity for young adults to learn and grow in
        this regard.
      </div>
      <div class="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</div>
      <div class="familiarize-a">
        Spending time on campus, especially in your freshman year, allows you to
        familiarize yourself with the dynamics of campus life and connect with
        fellow students. While occasional visits home may be enjoyable, frequent
        trips may lead to a sense of isolation or discomfort on campus. Immerse
        yourself in the campus atmosphere to build a sense of belonging.
      </div>
      <div class="familiarize">22. Familiarize Yourself with Campus</div>
      <div class="services-a">
        The career services center is a valuable campus resource for students.
        Advisors can assist you in refining your resume, honing interview
        skills, and navigating the job search process. Freshman year is an ideal
        time to explore your interests and potential career paths related to
        your major.
      </div>
      <div class="services">21. Utilize Career Services</div>
      <div class="new-a">
        College is a time to step out of your comfort zone and explore diverse
        activities. Embrace the chance to try new hobbies, sports, or
        activities. With a new environment and people, seize the opportunity to
        diversify your experiences and discover unexplored facets of yourself.
      </div>
      <div class="new">20. Try Something New</div>
      <div class="engage-a">
        Actively participating in campus life goes beyond making new
        connections; it serves as a substantial addition to your resume. Explore
        opportunities such as community service, clubs, organizations,
        intramural sports, and academic honors societies. These experiences not
        only help you acquire new skills but also foster friendships and uncover
        your passions.

        Early registration ensures a better selection of classes. Some colleges
        randomize registration order, so consult with your academic adviser to

        Make sure to read and save this document in a safe place, and refer back
        to it when you have course questions. Professors include the names of
        required textbooks, how to contact them, their office hours, assignment
        schedules, class meeting times, and the room.
      </div>
      <div class="review-a">
        You may have come across this word when talking about university life,
        but have no clue what it means. The syllabus is a vital resource and
        magic guide for understanding each of your classes. Professors upload
        the syllabus online or hand it out during the first week of classes.
      </div>
      <div class="review">17. Review Your Syllabus</div>
      <div class="resources-a">
        Leverage university resources like tutoring, mentoring, and learning

        improvement suggestions for assignments. These services are often free,
        so make the most of them.
      </div>
      <div class="resources">16. Utilize Academic Resources</div>
      <div class="strive-a">
        Set academic goals at the beginning of each semester and work diligently
        to achieve them. Consistently refer to study tips, seek help when
        needed, and consider meeting with professors for academic assistance.
      </div>
      <div class="strive">15. Strive for Academic Excellence</div>
      <div class="exchange-a">
        Exchange phone numbers with classmates not only for building friendships

        someone to share notes with, or a resource for missed class materials.

      <div class="professors">13. Get to Know Your Professors</div>
      <div class="identify-b">
        The other part of this tip is to learn how to study. College isn’t like
        high school, where you can sometimes get by with little to no studying.
        The course content is much more complex and requires a higher level of
        thinking, so allocate enough time to master each topic. This looks
        different for everyone; maybe you like to take notes, review class
        slides, visit a tutor, or even ask your professor for permission to
        record lectures.
      </div>
      <div class="identify-a">
        Find a place (or places) on campus where you can study effectively. It
        should be a place that’s quiet and free of distractions where you can
        focus. Maybe that’s your dorm room, the library, or a café–find a place
        that suits you!

        College assignments differ from high school, ranging from semester-long

        cramming.

      <div class="tasks">11. Stay Ahead on Academic Tasks</div>
      <div class="attend-a">
        Unlike high school, college doesn't enforce attendance, but it's crucial

        mandatory.

        Recognize that college life comes with challenges. If you feel
        overwhelmed, anxious, or lost, don't hesitate to seek help. Utilize the
        resources available, such as counseling and health centers, or confide
        in friends and family for guidance and support.

      <div class="responsibility-a">
        College marks the transition to adulthood, requiring a heightened sense

      <div class="healthy">6. Stay Healthy</div>
      <div class="cope-a">
        Homesickness is a common experience for freshmen. Coping mechanisms
        vary; some find solace in calling home, while others prefer cooking
        familiar meals or having regular video calls with family. Identify what
        works best for you.
      </div>
      <div class="cope">5. Cope with Homesickness</div>
      <div class="home-a">
        While immersing yourself in college life, make an effort to regularly
        connect with family and friends back home. A word of caution—while
        staying connected is crucial, excessive calls may intensify
        homesickness. Strike a balance to fully enjoy your college environment.

      <div class="home3">4. Connect with Home</div>
      <div class="organized-a">
        Juggling academics, social life, and activities can be challenging.

        Despite a busy college life, allocate time for yourself. Dedicate an

        The first step is to talk to people. Be friendly wherever you go. Get
        out of your comfort zone. Be social even if it feels awkward at first.
        You will need to build a support network for the next four years. It
        might seem intimidating at first, but you’ll find that many people feel
        the same way you do, and you probably have a lot more in common with
        people than you might think!

      <div class="friends-a">
        Make Friends You have many chances to meet new people on campus, such as
